# TODOs

1. **Implement `FoldMap`**

   - Description: Combine `fold` and `map` into a single operation that maps over a structure, then folds the result using a monoid.
   - Goals: Enhance efficiency by combining transformations and reductions in one pass.

2. **Lazy Evaluation Utilization**

   - Description: Implement lazy evaluation features similar to Haskell's thunks or streams to handle infinite data structures.
   - Goals: Allow processing of potentially infinite streams of data efficiently.

3. **Monads**

   - Description: Implement basic monads like `Maybe`, `Either`, and `IO` to manage side effects and errors more functionally.
   - Goals: Provide robust error handling and side effect management in a functional way.

4. **Combinators for Function Composition**

   - Description: Add combinators like `compose` and `pipe` to facilitate easier function chaining and composition.
   - Goals: Simplify complex function combinations and enhance code readability.

5. **Immutable Data Structures**
   - Description: Implement or integrate persistent data structures that are immutable.
   - Goals: Encourage pure functions and avoid side effects from shared mutable state.

### Improvements to Existing Code

1. **Enhance `groupBy` with Custom Aggregators**

   - Description: Extend the `groupBy` function to accept an aggregator function, allowing for summaries like sum, average, etc.
   - Goals: Make `groupBy` more versatile and useful for data analysis tasks.

2. **Optimize Recursive Functions**

   - Description: Review and optimize recursive functions like `Foldr` and `Foldl` for stack safety and performance.
   - Goals: Prevent stack overflow in deep recursions and improve execution speed.

3. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Description: Ensure that all functions properly handle errors and exceptional cases, especially those that work with external resources or complex data.
   - Goals: Improve the robustness and reliability of the library.

### General Project Enhancements

1. **Benchmarking and Performance Analysis**

   - Description: Set up benchmarks for all key functions to measure and optimize performance.
   - Goals: Ensure that the library performs efficiently even under heavy loads.

2. **Documentation and Examples**

   - Description: Create detailed documentation and real-world examples for each function in the library.
   - Goals: Make the library user-friendly and accessible to newcomers.

3. **Unit Testing Expansion**

   - Description: Expand the test suite to cover edge cases, performance tests, and integration scenarios.
   - Goals: Ensure high reliability and catch potential issues early in the development cycle.

4. **Community Contributions and Code Reviews**

   - Description: Set up a contribution guideline and review process to encourage community involvement.
   - Goals: Improve code quality and incorporate community insights and improvements.

5. **Create Interactive Tutorials**
   - Description: Develop interactive tutorials or a small web application demonstrating the use of the library.
   - Goals: Enhance learning resources and provide hands-on experience with functional programming concepts.
